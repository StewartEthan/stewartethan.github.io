# stewartethan.github.io
Source code for my web development sandbox/portfolio site

Normally, a site like this wouldn't have all the components in the repo, and
I would put instructions here for you to fork/clone and run ```npm install```
to get them locally, but it seemed easier to just include them here since this
is not only a codebase, but also what GitHub directly pulls from to render
[my GitHub Pages site].
